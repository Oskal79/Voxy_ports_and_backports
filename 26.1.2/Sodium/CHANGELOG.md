----------
Sodium [SodiumVersion]() for Minecraft [MCVersion]() introduces asynchronous occlusion culling alongside other small improvements and fixes for crashes to improve stability.

This generally improves performance and avoids the frame rate dropping when the camera is moved, especially at high render distances. This feature has been in the works for a long time now, and together with the release for Minecraft 26.2, we've decided to release it. More work is planned, including improvements to the task scheduling system and optimizations to improve responsiveness.

- Implementation of Asynchronous Graph Culling and Frame-Independent Task Scheduling ([#2887](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/2887))
- Fix rare issues with chunk fading
- Fix crash when using `-Dmixin.debug=true` ([#3689](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3689))
- Only make environment changes if the early window will create a gl context early ([#3697](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3697))
- Improve the presentation and wording of some video options ([#3700](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3700))

- Fix crashes resulting from unsafe concurrency in async culling "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" ([#3756](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3756))
- Improved mod compatibility by using occlusion culling from camera render state ([#3764](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3764))
- Optimize checks for immediate presentation in RSM ([#3768](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3768))
- Cache max draw size in MultiDrawBatch instead of scanning every frame ([#3773](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3773))

- Internal code quality improvements and cleanup
- Remove extra ABGR conversion to fix incorrect falling block coloration ([#3798](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3798))
- Fix non-terrain block lighting ([#3800](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3800))
- Fix command line not being restored after NeoForge early window init ([#3803](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3803))

Iris versions 1.11.1 and older are not compatible, and you will need to download an appropriate version from Modrinth, or if no such version is available there, from the Iris Discord server.
